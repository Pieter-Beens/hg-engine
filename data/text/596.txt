It looks a little bit evil.\nHow about this TM for it?\r
                     
There are sure to be TMs that are\njust perfect for your Pokémon.

Hey kid, I’m looking for something\nspecific. Do you have a DROWZEE?\rWant to trade it? I will give\nyou something good in return.\rI promise.\r...\rCome on I mean it, I have a very\nrare Pokémon that’s just right for\fsomeone your age.\rI really need that DROWZEE to\nput me to sleep.\rAre you going to help me? \v0200\x0001\x0000
Thanks a million kid! That plush\nanimal never did me any good.\rNow I can just ask DROWZEE to put me to sleep...
Huh? That’s not DROWZEE.\nWho’s the scammer now?
You don’t trust me?\rCome on kid, I'm desperate...
Huh? Oh it’s you again.\rI’m a bit groggy...\rI’ve been sleeping a lot more\nthanks to your DROWZEE, but perhaps\fa little too much?\rNow I feel exhausted from sleeping!\rAlso DROWZEE keeps showing up\nin my dreams...\rAnyway how is your plush- I mean,\nhow is your rare Pokémon doing?\rOh, it’s weak? Well, I bet if you\ntreat it right it will evolve...
Huh? You...are part of Team Rocket?\nSince when?
On Sundays, a lady comes to check\nout Pokémon.\rShe even gives away TMs!
Team Rocket...\nWhy are they here?
You can’t rename a Pokémon you get in\na trade.\rThe name is a reflection of the original\nTrainer’s feelings for it.
You shouldn’t wear a black suit like\nthat. People will think you are a part\fof Team Rocket.\rWhat? You are one of them?
