Anna: Hi! My name is Anna!\r...Oh, it is you!\nWe met at the Radio Tower just now.\rMy friends were into Pokémon, so,\nI got into it too!\rPokémon are super cute!\rYou want to battle?\rI’m... not really good at the\nbattling stuff yet.\rI was only made Gym Leader last week,\nand only because the League Champion\freally likes me.\rI don’t think I deserve to be here,\nbut I want to try my best!\rPlease be nice to my Pokémon!\r
Anna: Sob...\r...Waaaaaaah!\nYou’re mean!\rYou shouldn’t be so serious!\nYou made SPHEAL sad...\rAnd my baby PRRING...\nWhy did you hit them so hard??\r 
Anna: Waaaaah!\rWaaaaah!\r...Snivel, hic.\n...You meanie!
Anna: Sniff...\rWhat’s that? Oh, the Badge?\rBut...\rOh, right. I forgot.\nThis is what it means to battle.\rSee, I should never have been\nmade Leader...\rOkay, you deserve this more than I.\nHere’s the Peep Badge.\r
\v0103ぁ\x0000\x0000 received\nthe Peep Badge from Anna.
Anna: The Peep Badge lets your\nPokémon use Strength outside\fof battle.\rOh, and there was something else...\r
                           
Anna: It’s Ear Whack!\nVery useful for waking people up.\rI use it on my boyfriend, but only\nwhen I have no other choice.\rHe has a very important job, but he\ntends to sleep in.\rIt hurts a little, so use it for the\ngreater good, okay?\rAnyway... I heard this thing called the\nPokéathlon Dome just opened right next\fto the National Park.\rYou should go try it, since you’re\nso good at battling with your Pokémon!\r
Anna: It seems my Pokémon are okay...\nBut I’m not sorry I cried. It’s very\ftherapeutic, you know?\r
Oh, no. You made Anna cry.\rIt’s OK. She’ll stop soon.\nShe always cries when her Pokémon\flook sad.\r
Yo! Champ in the making!\rThis Gym is home to Sound-type\nPokémon Trainers.\rI recommend you use Bug-types,\nsince they can’t hear very well,\fand that’s to their benefit here!\rElectric-types can also mess with the\nsound waves, and Grass or Snow can\fdampen their impact.\r
You won? Great! I was busy admiring\nthe powerful Trainers here.
