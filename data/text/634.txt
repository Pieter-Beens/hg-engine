DRAGONAIR’s cute, but I don’t have\none. Do you have DRAGONAIR㊛?\rWant to trade it for my NOIBAT? \v0200\x0001\x0000
Wow! Thank you!\nI always wanted DRAGONAIR!
That’s not DRAGONAIR㊛.\nPlease trade with me if you get one.
You don’t want to trade?\nOh, darn...
How is that NOIBAT I traded you doing?\rYour DRAGONAIR’s so cute!\nAnd importantly, not as noisy...
Oh?\nYour \v0100ぁ\x0000\x0000...\r
It has worked stupendously hard,\nhasn’t it?\rAs its reward, please give it\nthe Effort Ribbon.\r
\v0103ぁ\x0001\x0000 received\nthe Effort Ribbon.\r
\v0103ぁ\x0001\x0000 put the Effort Ribbon\non \v0100ぁ\x0000\x0000.
It needs to work a little harder.\rIf it does, I’ll give your Pokémon\nsomething nice.
It’s working a little harder, I see.\rBut it will need some more effort!
It’s working hard, I see.\rBut it will need just a little\nmore effort!
It’s working quite hard, I see.\rBut it will need a tiny bit\nmore effort!
It’s working so hard, I see.\rIt’s almost there.\nJust the smallest bit of effort, and\fit’ll be there!
Oh! That Effort Ribbon looks\ngood on your \v0100ぁ\x0000\x0000!
